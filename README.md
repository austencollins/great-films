**Great stories, well told.**  

These films purposefully diverge from those on common internet lists. They don't share genre or culture. What they do share is masterful writing and execution. Most recently added first.

## Prospect - 2018

A teenage girl and her father travel to a remote alien moon, aiming to strike it rich. They've secured a contract to harvest a large deposit of the elusive gems hidden in the depths of the moon's toxic forest.

**Why:** The writing expertly crafts situations where the character has no other choices engaging you logically and emotionally as they are pushed more deeply into crises. Also, if you're a fan of westerns, this has a wonderful Treasure of the Sierra Madre vibe.
